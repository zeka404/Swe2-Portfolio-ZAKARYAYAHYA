- The practical use of Builder, Factory, Adapter, Decorator, Observer, and Singleton patterns.
- How abstraction and polymorphism improve system flexibility.

## What was challenging

- Integrating multiple patterns together without increasing code complexity.

## What I improved from previous tasks
- Better object-oriented design skills.
- Improved ability to write scalable and maintainable Python code.
- Better understanding of design pattern trade-offs.
