# Design Patterns Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of multiple software design patterns
using Python in an object-oriented system.

The system models different geometric shapes and applies various design patterns
to improve flexibility, reusability, maintainability, and scalability of the code.
Each pattern is implemented in a practical context to show its real-world usage.

The project also follows clean code principles and uses abstraction and polymorphism
to decouple components.
