# Unit Testing and Automation Testing Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of Unit Testing and basic Automation
Testing concepts using Python.

The system tests a shapes application that applies multiple design patterns.
Unit tests are written to verify the correctness of individual components,
while automation-style execution simulates running the system as a whole.

The project ensures code reliability, correctness, and maintainability
by validating expected behaviors and edge cases.
