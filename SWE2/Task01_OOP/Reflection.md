# Reflection - Task01_Shapes_Project

## What I Learned
- How to design and implement abstract classes and inheritance for multiple shapes.
- Applying OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
- Calculating area and perimeter for different geometric shapes using formulas.
- Writing reusable code that works for multiple shapes.

## What Was Challenging
- Designing a proper class hierarchy that avoids redundant code.
- Implementing the Ellipse perimeter formula accurately.
- Ensuring the program can handle different shapes uniformly.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
- Better understanding of abstract classes and method overriding.
- Improved code organization and readability.
- Learned how to write flexible code that can easily support new shapes.
