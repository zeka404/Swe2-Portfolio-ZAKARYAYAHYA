# Task01_Shapes_Project

## Task Description
This task demonstrates the creation of geometric shapes classes and calculation of their properties (area and perimeter) using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The project models shapes such as Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Square, and Ellipse. 

Students are required to:
- Implement the classes for each shape.
- Ensure that each shape class has methods to calculate area and perimeter.
- Use abstraction and inheritance to avoid code duplication and ensure maintainability.
- Implement a function to print the shape's information.

### Supported Languages
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

## Files Included
- shapes.py (Python implementation) or equivalent in Java/JS
- Any diagrams explaining class relationships (optional)
