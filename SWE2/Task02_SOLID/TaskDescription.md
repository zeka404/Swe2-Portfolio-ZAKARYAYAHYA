# SOLID Principles Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of SOLID principles using Python.
The system models different geometric shapes and provides a flexible way to
calculate their area and perimeter while supporting extensibility and maintainability.

The design follows object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction,
inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring that new shapes or output formats
can be added without modifying existing code.
